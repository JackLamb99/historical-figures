### Game Page - Active Game

* Clicking the “Play” button will display the game page and automatically start a new game.
* Users will then have 10 seconds, which counts down in the centre of the page, to submit an answer.
* The “Younger” and “Older” answer submission buttons are placed directly under the bottom card, which makes it clear that they must compare that historical figure to the one above.
* The “is…” text was an addition made after an initial round of user feedback to reinforce the aim of the game, by forming a “This figure is younger/older” statement in the users’ head when coupled with the buttons directly below.
